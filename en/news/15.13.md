## 2. GXDE Backports: Rewriting Dtk5 Applications with Dtk2 for a Unified Style

From the previous image, you can see some applications that only appear in deepin 20+.  
The GXDE team has obtained resources from deepin's historical code and gradually rewritten Dtk5 applications, allowing GXDE to have the same functionality and experience as the new DDE.

## 3. Multi-threaded Intelligent Mirror Accelerated Download

When installing applications using the command line, replacing `apt` and `apt-get` with `aptss` can provide faster download speeds. The GXDE OS system source has been connected to the aptss multi-thread acceleration service.
