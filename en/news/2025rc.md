## Installation Notes

The RC version is part of the closed beta by default. Stability is not guaranteed, and it is intended for early adopters. Users seeking stability should wait for the Stable version after Debian Trixie's official release.

## Known Issues in RC

- Control Center cannot read KWin window control shortcut configurations but can still set them normally.
