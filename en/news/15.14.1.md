## Adjustments
- Fine-tuned the title bar of gtk applications, slightly enlarged to adapt to high scaling ratios (due to KWin implementation issues, the title bar size cannot change with scaling, full implementation will wait for GXDE KWin 5.27/GXDE 15.15).
- Added internationalization for Compact Mode in Control Center - Personalization.
- Removed the v20 launcher.
- Removed "Select All" from the desktop right-click menu, without affecting the file manager interface.
- No longer displays all wallpaper links in Pictures, instead displays them in Pictures/GXDE to prevent affecting user configurations.
- No longer starts anything in deepin-desktop-base, but uses a separate deepin-anything-server-service, and no longer checks for the uninstallation of deepin-installer.
- Updated the mainline/Huawei Hisilicon kernel on arm to 6.11.3.
- Changed the Control Center website to .org.
- Removed the GXDE Downloader.
