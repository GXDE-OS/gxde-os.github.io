## Introduction

For many users, Deepin 15 is still a classic version, but its underlying system is quite outdated (Debian 9) and cannot run new programs. To solve this issue, GXDE was created based on an updated foundation, allowing DDE 15 to return to people's attention.

(GXDE stands for Gorgeous eXtended Deepin Environment)
