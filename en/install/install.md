**For ISO versions 15.13 and below, Legacy BIOS currently only supports installation using the Debian installer. Select "Advanced options" on the boot screen and then choose "Install." This issue will be resolved in version 15.14.**

For Beginners: If you don't know how to partition, leave some space on a disk and select to install on the whole disk during installation.

EFI Installation: You must create a partition formatted as vfat/fat32 with the mount point set to /boot/efi. The remaining space can be partitioned as needed.

## APT Repository Installation
> For amd64, arm64, etc., where ISO installation images are available, it is recommended to use ISO installation.  
> Currently supports amd64, arm64, mips64, and loong64, but loong64 has not been tested.

Download the deb file and install it from https://pan.huang1111.cn/s/k2nRvuB.

After installation, run:

```bash
sudo apt update

sudo apt install spark-store -y

sudo aptss install gxde-testing-source -y

sudo aptss install gxde-desktop gxde-desktop-extra -y
```

Then restart.
